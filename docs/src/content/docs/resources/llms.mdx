# LLM-Friendly Documentation

@f0rbit/runbook provides machine-readable documentation files optimized for consumption by AI assistants, LLM-powered coding tools, and automated documentation pipelines.

## Available Files

| File | Size | Contents |
|------|------|----------|
| [`llms.txt`](/runbook/llms.txt) | ~2 KB | Concise project overview — installation, core concepts, packages, CLI commands |
| [`llms-full.txt`](/runbook/llms-full.txt) | ~80 KB | Comprehensive reference — full README, use cases, API exports, all documentation pages |

## Usage

### With AI Coding Assistants

Point your AI assistant to the appropriate file based on your needs:

**Quick context** — use `llms.txt` when you need the assistant to understand what runbook is and how to use it:

```
Read https://f0rbit.github.io/runbook/llms.txt for project context
```

**Full reference** — use `llms-full.txt` when you need comprehensive API details, configuration options, or in-depth guides:

```
Read https://f0rbit.github.io/runbook/llms-full.txt for full documentation
```

### In Tool Configuration

Many AI-powered tools support documentation URLs for project context:

```json
{
  "docs": "https://f0rbit.github.io/runbook/llms-full.txt"
}
```

### What's Included

**`llms.txt` contains:**
- Project description and installation
- Core concepts (step types, workflows, providers, traces)
- Package overview (4 packages with descriptions)
- CLI command reference (11 commands)
- Links to full docs and GitHub

**`llms-full.txt` contains:**
- Complete README with code examples
- Full use case document with comparisons
- Per-package API exports from source
- CLI command reference with all options
- All documentation pages (stripped of formatting metadata)
- Configuration reference

## Generation

These files are generated automatically during the docs build process from:
- Repository README and USECASE documents
- Package export files (`packages/*/src/index.ts`)
- All documentation pages (`docs/src/content/docs/**/*.mdx`)

The generation script runs before each Astro build, ensuring the LLM docs stay in sync with the documentation site.

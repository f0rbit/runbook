### Typed workflow engine for orchestrating AI agents, shell commands, and human checkpoints

Define workflows as typed pipelines. Wire AI agents, shell commands, and human checkpoints into composable steps — with Zod schemas enforcing correctness at every boundary.

---

## Features

### Type Safety

Zod schemas at every step boundary. Mis-wired pipelines fail at compile time, not runtime.

### Agent Steps

AI agents as first-class workflow steps with typed I/O. Analyze mode for JSON output, build mode for code generation.

### Testable

In-memory providers for instant, deterministic tests. No mocking, no network calls, no API costs.

### Traces

Typed event streams, not string logs. 14 event types covering workflow lifecycle, agent sessions, and checkpoints.

### Git Store

Every prompt, response, and tool call stored in git refs. Invisible to `git log`, pushable/pullable.

### Composable

`pipe()`, `parallel()`, `asStep()`. Build complex workflows from simple, reusable pieces.

---

## Quick Example

A minimal workflow that dispatches to an AI agent with fully typed input and output:

```typescript
import { agent, defineWorkflow } from "@f0rbit/runbook";
import { z } from "zod";

const analyze = agent({
  id: "analyze",
  input: z.object({ code: z.string() }),
  output: z.object({ issues: z.array(z.string()), severity: z.enum(["low", "medium", "high"]) }),
  prompt: (input) => `Analyze this code:\n${input.code}`,
});

const workflow = defineWorkflow(z.object({ code: z.string() }))
  .pipe(analyze, (wf) => ({ code: wf.code }))
  .done("code-review", z.object({ issues: z.array(z.string()), severity: z.enum(["low", "medium", "high"]) }));
```

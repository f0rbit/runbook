# Installation

## Prerequisites

Runbook requires the [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime. Node.js is not supported in v0.1.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## Packages

The project is split into focused packages — install only what you need.

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@f0rbit/runbook` | Core SDK — types, step builders, workflow builder, trace types |
| `@f0rbit/runbook-server` | Hono HTTP server — engine, providers, routes, state |
| `@f0rbit/runbook-cli` | Thin CLI client — HTTP client, command handlers, config |
| `@f0rbit/runbook-git-store` | Git-based artifact store for workflow traces and agent sessions |

### Peer dependencies

All packages expect `zod` and `@f0rbit/corpus` as peer dependencies:

- **zod** — schema definitions and runtime validation
- **@f0rbit/corpus** — `Result<T, E>` types for error handling without exceptions

## Typical install

Most users need the core SDK, the server (which includes the engine), and the peer dependencies:

```bash
bun add @f0rbit/runbook @f0rbit/runbook-server zod @f0rbit/corpus
```

Install the CLI globally to run workflows from the terminal:

```bash
bun add -g @f0rbit/runbook-cli
```

### Individual packages

Install packages individually if you only need a subset:

```bash
# Core SDK only (for defining workflows and types)
bun add @f0rbit/runbook

# Server (engine + HTTP routes)
bun add @f0rbit/runbook-server

# CLI client
bun add @f0rbit/runbook-cli

# Git-based artifact store
bun add @f0rbit/runbook-git-store
```

## Development setup

For contributors working on the runbook project itself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/f0rbit/runbook
cd runbook
bun install
```

The repository is a Bun workspace monorepo with packages under `packages/`. After installing, verify everything works:

```bash
# Type checking
bun run typecheck

# Run all tests
bun test

# Lint (uses Biome, not ESLint)
bun run lint
```

## What's next

Now that you have runbook installed, build your first workflow in the [Quick Start](/runbook/getting-started/quick-start/).
